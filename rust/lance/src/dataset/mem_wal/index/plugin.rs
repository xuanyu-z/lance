//! The extension point for memtable-resident indexes.
//!
//! A memtable index is not an index format. It is a mutable accumulator that
//! lives for one memtable: it takes rows as they are written, answers queries
//! against rows that have not been flushed yet, and at flush hands the ordinary
//! index builder whatever it can save it. The index that lands on disk is
//! always built by that ordinary builder, so a plugin adds a maintenance
//! strategy, never a storage format.
//!
//! Registering a plugin is the whole integration. Nothing else in the memtable
//! names an index kind, so a registered plugin is discovered from the base
//! table's index metadata, maintained on every write path, charged to the
//! memory budget, consulted by the query planner, and flushed without further
//! wiring.
//!
//! # What a plugin has to write
//!
//! Two traits. [`MemIndexPlugin`] declares the kind — which base-table index it
//! maintains, how to build one, how a filter reaches it. [`MemIndex`] is one
//! instance: take rows, answer questions, say what you cost, hand something
//! over at flush.
//!
//! A scalar plugin does not define a query vocabulary. It returns the same
//! [`ScalarQueryParser`] its on-disk index uses from
//! [`MemIndexPlugin::query_parser`], and then answers the same
//! [`AnyQuery`](lance_index::scalar::AnyQuery) types in
//! [`MemIndex::search`]. Everything a filter can express against the on-disk
//! index — comparisons, ranges, `IN`, `IS NULL`, `LIKE`, a spatial or
//! full-text function — reaches the memtable index for free, and the two
//! cannot drift apart.
